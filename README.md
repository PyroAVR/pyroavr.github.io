# Andy's Resume
## (Find me online!)[https://andymeyer.xyz]
This is the master branch, containing source code and build definitions.
If you want to build it, the command is:
`npm run build`

If you aren't familiar with frontend, this is **not a getting started guide**.
I do not know what I'm doing. I wrote this so that I can have an online presence
in these times when I have to apply to everything online.

That said, it is the only way I could find to build a static site with no JS,
whatsoever. It is entirely HTML/CSS in the browser, but uses fancy things like
(TailwindCSS)[https://tailwindcss.com] and
(Autoprefixer)[https://autoprefixer.github.io] via
(PostCSS)[https://postcss.org], all projects that are clearly awesome.

This isn't a template repository, but if you want to try making your resume from
it and you enjoy both a painful development experience and throwing all caution
to the wind, feel free to clone/fork/whatever and hack on it!
